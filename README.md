TIASvc

TIASvc is a Rust-based service designed as a modular and scalable solution for interacting with Celestia blockchain networks and APIs. 
Built as a Cargo workspace, TIASvc separates concerns into multiple cratesâ€”each handling distinct layers of the application. 
It integrates with external services such as Circle Mint, Celestia RPC, Infura, and various smart contract networks.
Making it suitable as a backend service for token-related operations and blockchain interactions.

Features
- Modular Architecture:
Organized as a Cargo workspace with dedicated crates for application logic, domain modeling, framework integration, and infrastructure implementations.

- Blockchain Integrations:
Provides configuration and support for connecting to blockchain networks via Celestia RPC and Infura.

- Smart Contract Interactions:
Prepares to interact with token contracts (e.g., USDC, LINK, WETH) and Uniswap's router contract.

- API Integrations:
Configurable integration with the Circle Mint API for token minting and related operations.

- Database Connectivity:
Uses a PostgreSQL database for persistence, with connection details provided via environment variables.


Getting Started
Prerequisites
Rust and Cargo:
Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed.

PostgreSQL:
Install and run PostgreSQL for database operations.

External API Credentials:
