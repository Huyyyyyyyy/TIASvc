TIASvc

TIASvc is a Rust-based service designed as a modular and scalable solution for interacting with Celestia blockchain networks and APIs. 
Built as a Cargo workspace, TIASvc separates concerns into multiple cratesâ€”each handling distinct layers of the application. 
It integrates with external services such as Circle Mint, Celestia RPC, Infura, and various smart contract networks.
Making it suitable as a backend service for token-related operations and blockchain interactions.

Features
- Modular Architecture:
Organized as a Cargo workspace with dedicated crates for application logic, domain modeling, framework integration, and infrastructure implementations.

- Blockchain Integrations:
Provides configuration and support for connecting to blockchain networks via Celestia RPC and Infura.

- Smart Contract Interactions:
Prepares to interact with token contracts (e.g., USDC, LINK, WETH) and Uniswap's router contract.

- API Integrations:
Configurable integration with the Circle Mint API for token minting and related operations.

- Database Connectivity:
Uses a PostgreSQL database for persistence, with connection details provided via environment variables.


Getting Started
Prerequisites
Rust and Cargo:
Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed.

PostgreSQL:
Install and run PostgreSQL for database operations.

External API Credentials:
Obtain API keys and endpoint URLs for Circle Mint, Celestia, and Infura as needed.

Installation
Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Huyyyyyyyy/TIASvc.git
cd TIASvc
```
Set Up Environment Variables:

Copy the provided .env.example file to a new .env file and fill in the required values:
Please fill out all the variables of the env
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```


Configuration
The project uses environment variables to configure external services. Below is an overview of the variables defined in .env.example:

```
Circle API:
CIRCLE_MINT_API_KEY: Your Circle Mint API key.
CIRCLE_MINT_BASE_URL: Base URL for the Circle API.
Celestia RPC:

CELESTIA_RPC_URL: URL for the Celestia RPC endpoint.
CELESTIA_AUTH_TOKEN: Authorization token for Celestia.
Infura:

INFURA_API_KEY: Your Infura API key.
INFURA_BASE_URL: Base URL for Infura.
Smart Contract Addresses:

CONTRACT_USDC: Address for the USDC token contract.
CONTRACT_LINK: Address for the LINK token contract.
CONTRACT_WETH: Address for the WETH token contract.
CONTRACT_ROUTER02: Address for the Uniswap Router contract.
Database:

DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string.
```

Project Structure
The repository is structured as a Cargo workspace with the following members:
```
crates/app:
Contains the core application logic and service orchestration.

crates/domain:
Defines domain models and business logic.

crates/framework:
Integrates with external frameworks and libraries, currently we use Rocket as framework providing the API template .
And this API will be processed on Serverless Lambda function.
For now we haven't had a debug environment yet .
Instead we have an available Lambda Function for you guys of function UI testing purposes.

crates/infra:
Houses infrastructure-related implementations (e.g., API clients, repositories such as Celestia RPC , Circle Mint, Infura API).

main:
Contains the entry point for running the service.
```
